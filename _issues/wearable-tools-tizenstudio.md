## Connection issue between a watch and Device Manager

Refer to [Testing Your App on Galaxy Watch][testing_app_on_watch] for information about developing your application and testing it on your watch.

Even if you follow every step correctly, you may face the following error:

![][device_mgr_connection]

```
 ERROR: failed to connect to remote target '192.168.0.X'

 You may get this message for following reasons:
  - This remote device is already connected by another one.
  - This remote device is running on a non-standard port.
  - There is no IP address, please check the physical connection.
```

### Workaround
 - Check whether both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
 - Reboot your PC and the watch, and connect to the network.
