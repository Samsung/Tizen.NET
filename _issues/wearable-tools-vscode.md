Visual Studio 2017 on Windows is the number one choice for developing Tizen .NET applications. However, if you are a Mac user, you have the option of using Visual Studio Code to develop Tizen .NET applications.

See [Installing Visual Studio Code Extension for Tizen](https://developer.tizen.org/development/visual-studio-code-extension-tizen/installing-visual-studio-code-extension-tizen) for information about the Tizen .NET extension.

The following known issues are based on Visual Studio Code Extension for Tizen version 1.1.0. For issue histories, see [Change Log](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/tizen.vscode-tizen-csharp/changelog).

## Version 1.1.0 (2019-01-08)
### Creating a Tizen .NET Project
  - command: `Tizen .NET: Create a Tizen .NET project`
    - An incomplete Xamarin.Forms template (`Tizen.NET.Template.Cross.NETStandard`) is generated.
    You must manually add the line `LoadApplication(new App());` in the file `[Name].[profile]/[Name].[profile].cs` to show your application contents on the device screen.
    ```c#
    protected override void OnCreate()
    {
        base.OnCreate();
        // Following line needs to be added manually.
        LoadApplication(new App());
    }
    ```
