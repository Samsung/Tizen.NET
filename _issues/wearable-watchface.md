## App Template Build Error

The following issue was fixed in Visual Studio Tools for Tizen, version 2.4 (released in March 2019).
{: .notice--danger}

### Error in Visual Studio Tools for Tizen, version 2.3.1
When you create a Tizen watch face application with the Tizen watch face app template, you may face an error during the build process because of an error in the `tizen-manifest.xml` file of the watch face app template.

To fix this error, modify the `tizen-manifest.xml` file as follows:

<blockquote>
<b>[AS-IS]</b>

<p><watch-application appid="org.tizen.example.TizenWatchfaceApp1" exec="TizenWatchfaceApp1.dll" type="dotnet" ambient-support="false" <span style="color:red">>></span></p>

<b>[TO-BE]</b>

<p><watch-application appid="org.tizen.example.TizenWatchfaceApp1" exec="TizenWatchfaceApp1.dll" type="dotnet" ambient-support="false" <span style="color:red">></span></p>

</blockquote>

### Watch face app execution with debugger on Samsung wearables

The following issue does not occur on the Tizen wearable emulator. An update will be globally released in May 2019.
{: .notice--danger}

An issue occurs when you execute a watch face application in debug mode (by pressing `F5` key). Changing the watch face may fail on Samsung wearables that are based on Tizen 4.0.

This error will be fixed soon. Until then, use one the following workarounds:
- Press `ctrl + F5` to execute the watch face application without debugger
- Change the watch face after running your application in debug mode and rebooting your Samsung smart watch.
