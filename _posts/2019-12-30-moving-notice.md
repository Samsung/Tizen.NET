## Tizen .NET Portal is moving to Samsung Developers
The [Tizen .NET Portal](https://samsung.github.io/Tizen.NET/) has provided a great deal of information about developing Tizen .NET applications. We keep [Posts](https://samsung.github.io/Tizen.NET/posts/) updated, and the GitHub board is always open for our developers.<br/>

Now, we are happy to announce that the portal will be integrated to the [Samsung Developers](https://developer.samsung.com/) website as of January 2020.

## Samsung Developers website will be renewed
With all developer content in one place, developers don't need to wander around. Just visit Samsung Developers and find everything about developing for Samsung in one place.

## Visit Samsung Developers and Explore Tizen .NET
We'll let you know when the new site is open.
