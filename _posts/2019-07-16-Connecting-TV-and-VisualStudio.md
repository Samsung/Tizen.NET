- Connect your computer and the TV to the same network.


## Enable `Developer Mode` on the TV
  1. On the TV, open the "Smart Hub".
  2. Select the "Apps" panel.<br>

## Connect TV to the Visual Studio
  1. In the Visual Studio, select "Tools > Tizen > Tizen Device Manager".<br>
     For Mac users, launch `device-manager`.

  3. In the "Add Device" popup, define the information for the TV you want to connect to, such as the name, IP address, and port number, and click "Add". Normally, you just need to put in the IP address.<br>

When the TV is successfully connected, you can see it on the Visual Studio toolbar.<br>

Now you can launch applications on the TV directly from the Visual Studio.

BUT, if the TV target device is Tizen 4.0, the debug run is not supported. Make sure you run application using `Start Without Debugging` (Ctrl+F5).
