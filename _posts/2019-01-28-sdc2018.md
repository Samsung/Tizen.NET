## Session
### What's New in Tizen .NET
Vincent Kwon, who is responsible for the Tizen .NET framework, led the "What's New in Tizen .NET" session.

Tizen .NET was adapted to Samsung TV products last year and provides a convenient way to develop applications on Samsung TV devices. This year, the new Galaxy Watch products have added Tizen .NET for its new application model. Developers can now benefit from the same productive development environment and useful APIs especially designed for Galaxy Watch devices. In this session, we will live-update the Tizen .NET framework and SDK for the third-party application developers for Samsung Galaxy Watch and TVs.
