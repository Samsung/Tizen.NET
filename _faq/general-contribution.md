## Contribution
We can make Tizen .NET better together.<br/>

Tizen .NET has been mostly developed on the public GitHub.<br/>
You can start contributing on the following projects.
Or opening an issue at any GitHub repository is also a great idea.

  - [Tizen .NET Portal](https://github.com/Samsung/Tizen.NET/)
  - [TizenFX](https://github.com/Samsung/TizenFX/)
  - [Tizen.CircularUI](https://github.com/Samsung/Tizen.CircularUI/)
  - [Tizen.TV.UIControls](https://github.com/Samsung/Tizen.TV.UIControls/)
  - [Tizen Developer Site](https://github.com/Samsung/tizen-docs/)

We will also keep an eye on the [Xamarin Forms repository](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms) to help on the issues that belong to the Tizen Platform.
