We're moving!

The Tizen .NET team is happy to announce that the [Tizen .NET Portal](https://samsung.github.io/Tizen.NET/) will be integrated to the [Samsung Developers](https://developer.samsung.com/) website as of January 2020.

The [Tizen .NET Portal](https://samsung.github.io/Tizen.NET/) provides great information about developing Tizen .NET applications.
[Posts](https://samsung.github.io/Tizen.NET/posts/) are kept updated, and the GitHub board is always open for our developers.<br/>

## Developer content all in one place
The new [Samsung Developers](https://developer.samsung.com/) website will have all developer content in one place. Here, all Samsung developers can easily find what they need to create and publish their apps. 

## Visit Samsung Developers and Explore Tizen .NET
We'll keep you updated about when the new site is open and ready for you to use.
